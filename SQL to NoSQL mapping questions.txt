MongoDB.


Do I need a tool for translating the queries !!! discutam data viitoare !!!, or for migrating the data? Or both?
Data migration might not be that hard, I just have to translate the data to JSON and then create the Mongo collections and documents.


What about relations? What if the SQL DB is normalized? Do I migrate the normalizations as well?
